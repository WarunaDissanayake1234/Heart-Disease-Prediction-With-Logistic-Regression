# Heart Disease Prediction Model with Logistic Regression

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts heart disease using Logistic Regression.

## Overview

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, implement Logistic Regression, and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Files

- `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression.
- `data/`: Directory containing the heart disease dataset obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises various health-related features and information related to heart disease cases. The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on these features.
